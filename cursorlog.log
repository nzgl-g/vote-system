# API Bridge Implementation
Created frontend API bridge to connect with server backend:

1. Base Infrastructure:
   - Created `/api` directory with client, config, and services structure
   - Implemented base ApiClient with GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods
   - Set up proper error handling and authentication token management

2. Service Implementations:
   - AuthService: Authentication handling with token storage
   - UserService: User profile, authentication and search operations
   - SessionService: Session management operations
   - CandidateService: Candidate application and management
   - TeamService: Team operations and member management
   - VoteService: Vote casting and results retrieval
   - NotificationService: User notification operations
   - InvitationService: Team and session invitations
   - SocketService: Real-time communication with WebSockets

3. Documentation:
   - Created README with usage examples and configuration instructions
   - Documented all API methods with JSDoc annotations
   - Provided code samples for common operations

The API bridge connects the frontend to the server without modifying any server-side code, creating a clean separation between frontend and backend.
