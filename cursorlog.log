# Session Selector Refactoring for Direct API Endpoints

Refactored the session selector component to use direct API endpoints for better performance:

1. Switched to Direct Session API Endpoints:
   - Replaced the team-based session loading with direct session endpoints
   - Now using `sessionService.getUserSessions()` for leader sessions
   - Now using `sessionService.getUserSessionsAsMember()` for member sessions
   - Eliminated the need for multiple individual session fetches

2. Improved Error Handling:
   - Added separate error handling for leader sessions and member sessions
   - Implemented specific error toasts for each session type
   - Maintained graceful degradation when one endpoint fails

3. Enhanced Data Handling:
   - Introduced separate caches for leader and member sessions
   - Simplified session data processing with clearer type handling
   - Removed unnecessary field extraction and validation
   - Streamlined session item creation from raw session data

4. Performance Optimizations:
   - Reduced API calls from N+1 to just 2 (one for leader sessions, one for member sessions)
   - Eliminated parallel request processing in favor of direct endpoint calls
   - Maintained caching and throttling mechanisms for performance
   - Preserved all UI features including blockchain contract indicators

This refactoring significantly improves performance by reducing the number of API calls, simplifies the code by using direct endpoints, and maintains all the existing functionality while making the component more maintainable.
